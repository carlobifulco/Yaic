         48. Ching / The Well</b>                            </p>
<p>  above K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER<br>
          below SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD</p>
                            
<p>  Wood is below, water above. The wood goes down into the earth to bring 
    up water. The image derives from the pole-and-bucket well of ancient China.
    The wood represents not the buckets, which in ancient times were made
of   clay, but rather the wooden poles by which the water is hauled up from
the   well. The image also refers to the world of plants, which lift water
out  of the earth by means of their fibers.  The well from which water is
drawn  conveys the further idea of an inexhaustible dispensing of nourishment.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  THE WELL. The town may be changed,<br>
          But the well cannot be changed.<br>
          It neither decreases nor increases.</p>
                            
<p>  They come and go and draw from the well.<br>
          If one gets down almost to the water<br>
          And the rope does not go all the way,<br>
          Or the jug breaks, it brings misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  In ancient China the capital cities were sometimes moved, partly for 
    the sake of more favorable location, partly because of a change in dynasties. 
    The style of architecture changed in the course of centuries, but the 
shape    of the well has remained the same from ancient times to this day. 
Thus the   well is the symbol of that social structure which, evolved by mankind
in  meeting its most primitive needs, is independent of all political forms.
 Political structures change, as do nations, but the life of man with its
needs remains eternally the same-this cannot be changed. Life is also inexhaustible.
 It grows neither less not more; it exists for one and for all. The generations
   come and go, and all enjoy life in its inexhaustible abundance.  However,
   there are two prerequisites for a satisfactory political or social organization
   of mankind. We must go down to the very foundations of life. For any merely
   superficial ordering of life that leaves its deepest needs unsatisfied
is   as ineffectual as if no attempt at order had ever been made. Carelessness-by
   which the jug is broken-is also disastrous. If for instance the military
  defense of a state is carried to such excess that it provokes wars by which
  the power of the state is annihilated, this is a breaking of the jug. 
This   hexagram applies also to the individual. However men may differ in
disposition   and in education, the foundations of human nature are the same
in everyone.   And every human being can draw in the course of his education
from the inexhaustible    wellspring of the divine in man's nature. But here
likewise two dangers  threaten:  a man may fail in his education to penetrate
to the real roots  of humanity  and remain fixed in convention-a partial
education of this sort  is as bad  as none- or he may suddenly collapse and
neglect his self-development.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Water over wood: the image of THE WELL.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the superior man encourages the people at their work,<br>
          And exhorts them to help one another.</p>
                            
<p>  The trigram Sun, wood, is below, and the trigram K'an, water, is above 
    it. Wood sucks water upward. Just as wood as an organism imitates the 
action    of the well, which benefits all parts of the plant, the superior 
man organizes    human society, so that, as in a plant organism, its parts 
co-operate for   the benefit of the whole.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  One does not drink the mud of the well.</p>
                            
<p>  No animals come to an old well.</p>
                            
<p>  If a man wanders around in swampy lowlands, his life is submerged in
mud. Such a man loses all significance for mankind. He who throws himself 
    away is no longer sought out by others. In the end no one troubles about 
   him any more.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  At the well hole one shoots fishes.</p>
                            
<p>  The jug is broken and leaks.</p>
                            
<p>  The water itself is clear, but it is not being used. Thus the well 
   is a place where only fish will stay, and whoever comes to it, comes only
    to catch fish. But the jug is broken, so that the fish cannot be kept
in   it.  This describes the situation of a person who possesses good qualities
   but neglects them. No one bothers about him. As a result he deteriorates
  in mind. He associates with inferior men and can no longer accomplish anything
   worth while.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The well is cleaned, but no one drinks from it.</p>
                            
<p>  This is my heart's sorrow,<br>
          For one might draw from it.<br>
          If the king were clear-minded,<br>
          Good fortune might be enjoyed in common.</p>
                            
<p>  An able man is available. He is like a purified well whose water is 
   drinkable. But no use is made of him. This is the sorrow of those who know
   him. One wishes that the prince might learn about it; this would be good
  fortune for all concerned.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The well is being lined. No blame.</p>
                            
<p>  True, if a well is being lined with sone, it cannot be used while the
work is going on. But the work is not in vain; the result is that the water
stays clear. In life also there are times when a man must put himself in
order. During such a time he can do nothing for others, but his work is nonetheless
valuable, because by enhancing his powers and abilities through inner development,
he can accomplish all the more later on.<br>
           Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  In the well there is a clear, cold spring<br>
          From which one can drink.</p>
                            
<p>  A well that is fed by a spring of living water is a good well. A man 
    who has virtues like a well of this sort is born to be a leader and savior 
    of men, for he has the water of life. Nevertheless, the character for 
"good    fortune" is left out here. The all-important thing about a well is
that  its  water be drawn. The best water is only a potentiality for refreshment 
  as long as it is not brought up. So too with leaders of mankind: it is all-important
    that one should drink from the spring of their words and translate them
  into  life.</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  One draws from the well<br>
          Without hindrance.<br>
          It is dependable.</p>
                            
<p>  Supreme good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  The well is there fore all. No one is forbidden to take water from 
   it. No matter how many come, all find what they need, for the well is dependable.
   It has a spring and never runs dry. Therefore it is a great blessing to
 the  whole land. The same is true of the really great man, whose inner wealth
  is inexhaustible; the more that people draw from him, the greater his wealth
   becomes.</p>
