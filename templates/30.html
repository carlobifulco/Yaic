         30. Li / The Clinging, Fire</b>                            </p>
<p>  above  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE<br>
          below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE</p>
                            
<p>  This hexagram is another double sign. The trigram Li means "to cling 
    to something," and also "brightness." A dark line clings to two light 
lines,    one above and one below--the image of an empty space between two 
strong  lines,  whereby the two strong lines are made bright. The trigram 
represents  the middle daughter. The Creative has incorporated the central 
line of the  Receptive,  and thus Li develops. As an image, it is fire. Fire 
has no definite  form but clings to the burning object and thus is bright. 
As water pours down from heaven, so fire flames up from the earth. While K'an
means the soul shut within the body, Li stands for nature in its radiance.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  THE CLINGING. Perseverance furthers.<br>
          It brings success.<br>
          Care of the cow brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  What is dark clings to what is light and so enhances the brightness 
   of the latter. A luminous thing giving out light must have within itself 
   something that perseveres; otherwise it will in time burn itself out. Everything
   that gives light is dependent on something to which it clings, in order
 that  it may continue to shine.  Thus the sun and moon cling to heaven,
and  grain,   grass, and trees cling to the earth. So too the twofold clarity
of the dedicated   man clings to what is right and thereby can shape the
world. Human life on  earth is conditioned and unfree, and when man recognizes 
this limitation  and makes himself dependent upon the harmonious and beneficent 
  forces of the cosmos, he achieves success. The cow is the symbol of extreme 
  docility. By cultivating in himself an attitude of compliance and voluntary 
  dependence,   man acquires clarity without sharpness and finds his place 
 in the world.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  That which is bright rises twice:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of FIRE.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the great man, by perpetuating this brightness,<br>
          Illumines the four quarters of the world.</p>
                            
<p>  Each of the two trigrams represents the sun in the course of a day. 
   The two together represent the repeated movement of the sun, the function 
    of light with respect to time. The great man continues the work of nature 
    in the human world. Through the clarity of his nature he causes the light 
    to spread farther and farther and to penetrate the nature of man ever 
more    deeply. </p>
                            
<p>  </p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  The footprints run crisscross.<br>
          If one is seriously intent, no blame.</p>
                            
<p>  It is early morning and work begins. The mind has been closed to the 
    outside world in sleep; now its connections with the world begin again. 
  The  traces of one's impressions run crisscross. Activity and haste prevail. 
  It  is important then to preserve inner composure and not to allow oneself 
  to  be swept along by the bustle of life. If one is serious and composed, 
  he can acquire the clarity of mind needed for coming to terms with the innumerable
    impressions that pour in. It is precisely at the beginning that serious
  concentration  is important, because the beginning holds the seed of all
 that is to follow.<br>
           Six in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Yellow light. Supreme good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Midday has come; the sun shines with a yellow light. Yellow is the 
   color of measure and mean. Yellow light is therefore a symbol of the highest
    culture and art, whose consummate harmony consists in holding to the
mean.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  In the light of the setting sun,<br>
          Men either beat the pot and sing<br>
          Or loudly bewail the approach of old age.<br>
          Misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Here the end of the day has come. The light of the setting sun calls 
    to mind the fact that life is transitory and conditional. Caught in this 
   external bondage, men are usually robbed of their inner freedom as well. 
  The sense of the transitoriness of life impels them to uninhibited revelry 
  in order to enjoy life while it lasts, or else they yield to melancholy 
and  spoil the precious time by lamenting the approach of old age. Both attitudes 
  are wrong. To the superior man it makes no difference whether death comes 
  early or late. He cultivates himself, awaits his allotted time, and in this
  way secures his fate.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Its coming is sudden;<br>
          It flames up, dies down, is thrown away.</p>
                            
<p>  Clarity of mind has the same relation to life that fire has to wood. 
    Fire clings to wood, but also consumes it. Clarity of mind is rooted in
  life  but can also consume it. Everything depends upon how the clarity functions.
    Here the image used is that of a meteor or a straw fire. A man who is
excitable    and restless may rise quickly to prominence but produces no
lasting effects.    Thus matters end badly when a man spends himself too rapidly
and consumes    himself like a meteor.<br>
           Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Tears in floods, sighing and lamenting.<br>
          Good fortune. </p>
                            
<p>  Here the zenith of life has been reached. Were there no warning, one 
    would at this point consume oneself like a flame. Instead, understanding 
   the vanity of all things, one may put aside both hope and fear, and sigh 
  and lament: if one is intent on retaining his clarity of mind, good fortune 
  will come from this grief. For here we are dealing not with a passing mood, 
  as in the nine in the third place, but with a real change of heart.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  The king used him to march forth and chastise.</p>
                            
<p>  Then it is best to kill the leaders<br>
          And take captive the followers. No blame.</p>
                            
<p>  It is not the purpose of chastisement to impose punishment blindly 
   but to create discipline. Evil must be cured at its roots. To eradicate 
  evil  in political life, it is best to kill the ringleaders and spare the 
  followers.  In educating oneself it is best to root out bad habits and tolerate
  those  that are harmless. For asceticism that is too strict, like sentences
  of undue  severity, fails in its purpose.</p>
