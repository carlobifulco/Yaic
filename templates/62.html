<p>  While in the hexagram Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT </p>

the strong lines preponderate and are within,     inclosed between weak lines
at the top and bottom, the present hexagram   has  weak lines preponderating,
though here again they are on the outside,   the  strong lines being within.
This indeed is the basis of the exceptional   situation  indicated by the
hexagram. When strong lines are outside, we have  the hexagram  I, PROVIDING
NOURISHMENT </p>

neither represents and exceptional state. When     strong elements within
preponderate, they necessarily enforce their will.     This creates struggle
and exceptional conditions in general. But in the   present  hexagram it
is the weak element that perforce must mediate with  the outside  world.
If a man occupies a position of authority for which he  is by nature  really
inadequate, extraordinary prudence is necessary.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL. Success.<br>
          Perseverance furthers.</p>
                            
<p>  Small things may be done; great things should not be done.</p>
                            
<p>  The flying bird brings the message:<br>
          It is not well to strive upward,<br>
          It is well to remain below.<br>
          Great good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Exceptional modesty and conscientiousness are sure to be rewarded with
success; however, if a man is not to throw himself away, it is important that
they should not become empty form and subservience but be combined always 
    with a correct dignity in personal behavior. We must understand the demands 
    of the time in order to find the necessary offset for its deficiencies 
 and   damages. In any event we must not count on great success, since the 
 requisite   strength is lacking. In this lies the importance of the message 
 that one  should not strive after lofty things but hold to lowly things. 
 The structure  of the hexagram gives rise to the idea that this message is
brought by a bird. In Ta Kuo, PREPONDERANCE OF THE GREAT </p>
                            
<p>  <a
 href="file:///c:/All_my_docs/YAIC/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#28">28</a>,
the four strong, heavy lines within, supported     only by two weak lines
without, give the image of a sagging ridgepole.  Here   the supporting weak
lines are both outside and preponderant; this gives the  image of a soaring
bird. But a bird should not try to surpass itself and fly into the sun; it
should descend to the earth, where its nest is. In this way it gives the
message conveyed by the hexagram.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Thunder on the mountain:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of PREPONDERANCE OF THE SMALL.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus in his conduct the superior man gives preponderance to reverence.<br>
          In bereavement he gives preponderance to grief.<br>
          In his expenditures he gives preponderance to thrift.</p>
                            
<p>  Thunder on the mountain is different from thunder on the plain. In 
   the mountains, thunder seems much nearer; outside the mountains, it is 
 less   audible than the thunder of an ordinary storm. Thus the superior man
 derives   an imperative from this image: he must always fix his eyes more
 closely and  more directly on duty than does the ordinary man, even though
 this might  make his behavior seem petty to the outside world. He is exceptionally
 conscientious   in his actions. In bereavement emotion means more to him
than ceremoniousness.   In all his personal expenditures he is extremely
simple and unpretentious.   In comparison with the man of the masses, all
this makes him stand out as   exceptional. But the essential significance
of his attitude lies in the fact  that in external matters he is on the side
of the lowly.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  The bird meets with misfortune through flying.</p>
                            
<p>  A bird ought to remain in the nest until it is fledged. If it tries 
   to fly before this, it invites misfortune. Extraordinary measures should 
   be resorted to only when all else fails. At first we ought to put up with 
   traditional ways as long as possible; otherwise we exhaust ourselves and 
  our energy and still achieve nothing.<br>
           Six in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  She passes by her ancestor<br>
          And meets her ancestress.<br>
          He does not reach his prince<br>
          And meets the official.</p>
                            
<p>  No blame.</p>
                            
<p>  Two exceptional situations are instanced here. In the temple of ancestors, 
    where alternation of generations prevails, the grandson stands on the 
same    side as the grandfather. Hence his closest relations are with the 
grandfather.    The present line designates the grandson's wife, who during 
the sacrifice    passes by the ancestor and goes toward the ancestress. This 
unusual behavior    is, however, an expression of her modesty. She ventures 
rather to approach    the ancestress, for she feels related to her by their 
common sex. Hence  here  deviation from the rule is not a mistake.  Another 
image is that of  the official  who, in compliance with regulation, first 
seeks an audience  with his prince.  If he is not successful in this, he does
not try to force  anything but goes  about conscientious fulfillment of his
duty, taking his  place among the other  officials. This extraordinary restraint
is likewise  not a mistake in exceptional  times. (The rule is that every
official should  first have an audience with  the prince by whom he is appointed.
Here the  appointment is made by the minister.)</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  If one is not extremely careful,</p>
                            
<p>  Somebody may come up from behind and strike him.<br>
          Misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>   At certain times extraordinary caution is absolutely necessary. But 
    it is just in such life situations that we find upright and strong personalities 
    who, conscious of being in the right, disdain to hold themselves on guard, 
    because they consider it petty. Instead, they go their way proud and unconcerned.
    But this self-confidence deludes them. There are dangers lurking for
which     they are unprepared. Yet such danger is not unavoidable; one can
escape   it  if he understands that the time demands that he pay especial
attention   to  small and insignificant thing.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  No blame. He meets him without passing by.<br>
          Going brings danger. One must be on guard.<br>
          Do not act. Be constantly persevering.</p>
                            
<p>  Hardness of character is tempered by yielding position so that no mistakes
are made. The situation here calls for extreme caution; one must make no
attempt of one's own initiative to reach the desired end. And if one were
to go on, endeavoring one must be on guard and not act but continue inwardly
to persevere.<br>
           Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Dense clouds,</p>
                            
<p>  No rain from our western territory.</p>
                            
<p>  The prince shoots and hits him who is in the cave.</p>
                            
<p>  As a high place is pictured here, the image of a flying bird has become 
    that of flying clouds. But dense as the clouds are, they race across the
   sky and give no rain. Similarly, in exceptional times there may be a born
   ruler who is qualified to set the world in order, but who cannot achieve
  anything or confer blessing on the people because he stands alone and has
  no helpers. Is such times a man must seek out helpers with whose aid he
can  carry out the task. But these helpers must be modestly sought out in
the retirement to which they have withdrawn. It is not in the fame nor their
great names but their genuine achievements that are important. Through such
modesty the right man is found, and the exceptional task is carried out in
spite of all difficulties.</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  He passes him by, not meeting him.</p>
                            
<p>  The flying bird leaves him.<br>
          Misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  This means bad luck and injury.</p>
                            
<p>  If one overshoots the goal, one cannot hit it. If a bird will not come
to its nest but flies higher and higher, it eventually falls into the hunter's
net. He who in times of extraordinary salience of small things does not know
how to call a halt, but restlessly seeks to press on and on, draws upon himself
misfortune at the hands of gods and men, because he deviates from the order
of nature.</p>
