         59. Huan / Dispersion [Dissolution]</b>                        
   </p>
<p>  above SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND<br>
          below K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER</p>
                            
<p>  Wind blowing over water disperses it, dissolving it into foam and mist.
This suggests that when a man's vital energy is dammed up within him (indicated
as a danger by the attribute of the lower trigram), gentleness serves to
break up and dissolve the blockage.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  DISPERSION. Success.</p>
                            
<p>  The king approaches his temple.<br>
          It furthers one to cross the great water.<br>
          Perseverance furthers.</p>
                            
<p>  The text of this hexagram resembles that of Ts'ui, GATHERING TOGETHER 
      </p>
                            
<p>  <a

In the latter, the subject is the bringing together     of elements that
have been separated, as water collects in lakes upon the    earth. Here the
subject is the dispersing and dissolving of divisive egotism.    DISPERSION
shows the way, so to speak, that leads to gathering together.   This explains
the similarity of the two texts.  Religious forces are needed   to overcome
the egotism that divides men. The common celebration of the great   sacrificial
feasts and sacred rites, which gave expression simultaneously    to the interrelation
and social articulation of the family and state, was    the means of employed
by the great ruler to unite men. The sacred music  and  the splendor of the
ceremonies aroused a strong tide of emotion that  was shared by all hearts
in unison, and that awakened a consciousness of the common origin of all
creatures. In this way disunity was overcome and rigidity dissolved. A further
means to the same end is co-operation in great general undertakings that
set a high goal for the will of the people;  in the common concentration
on this goal, all barriers dissolve, just as,  when a boat is crossing a
great stream, all hands must unite in a joint task.   But only a man who
is himself free of all selfish ulterior considerations,  and who perseveres
in justice and steadfastness, is capable of so dissolving  the hardness of
egotism.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  The wind drives over the water:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of DISPERSION.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the kings of old sacrificed to the Lord<br>
          And built temples.</p>
                            
<p>  In the autumn and winter, water begins to freeze into ice. When the 
   warm breezes of spring come, the rigidity is dissolved, and the elements 
   that have been dispersed in ice floes are reunited. It is the same with 
 the  minds of the people. Through hardness and selfishness the heart grows 
 rigid,  and this rigidity leads to separation from all others. Egotism and 
 cupidity  isolate men. Therefore the hearts of men must be seized by a devout 
 emotion.  They must be shaken by a religious awe in face of eternity-stirred 
 with an  intuition of the One Creator of all living beings, and united through 
  the  strong feeling of fellowship experienced in the ritual of divine worship.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  He brings help with the strength of a horse.<br>
          Good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  It is important that disunion should be overcome at the outset, before 
    it has become complete-that the clouds should be dispersed before they 
 have   brought storm and rain. At such times when hidden divergences in temper
  make  themselves felt and lead to mutual misunderstandings we must take
quick  and  vigorous action to dissolve the misunderstandings and mutual distrust.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  At the dissolution<br>
          He hurries to that which supports him.<br>
          Remorse disappears.</p>
                            
<p>  When an individual discovers within himself the beginnings of alienation 
    from others, of misanthropy and ill humor, he must set about dissolving 
  these  obstructions. He must rouse himself inwardly, hasten to that which 
  supports  him. Such support is never found in hatred, but always in a moderate 
  and just judgment of men, linked with good will. If he regains this unobstructed 
   outlook on humanity, while at the same time all saturnine ill humor is 
dissolved,    all occasion for remorse disappears.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  He dissolves his self. No remorse.</p>
                            
<p>  Under certain circumstances, a man's work may become so difficult that
he can no longer think of himself. He must set aside all personal desires 
    and disperse whatever the self gathers about it to serve as a barrier 
against    others. Only on the basis of great renunciation can he obtain the
strength    for great achievements. By setting his goal in a great task outside
himself,    he can attain this standpoint.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  He dissolves his bond with his group.</p>
                            
<p>  Supreme good fortune.<br>
          Dispersion leads in turn to accumulation.</p>
                            
<p>  This is something that ordinary men do not think of.</p>
                            
<p>  When we are working at a task that affects the general welfare, we 
   must leave all private friendships out of account. Only by rising above 
  party  interests can we achieve something decisive. He who has the courage 
  thus to forego what is near wins what is afar. But in order to comprehend 
  this standpoint, one must have a wide view of the interrelationships of 
life,  such as only unusual men attain.<br>
           Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  His loud cries are as dissolving as sweat.<br>
          Dissolution! A king abides without blame.</p>
                            
<p>  In times of general dispersion and separation, a great idea provides 
    a focal point for the organization of recovery. Just as an illness reaches 
    its crisis in a dissolving sweat, so a great stimulating idea is a true 
  salvation  in times of general deadlock. It gives the people a rallying 
point-a  man in a ruling position who can dispel misunderstandings.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  He dissolves his blood.<br>
          Departing, keeping at a distance, going out,<br>
          Is without blame.</p>
                            
<p>  The idea of the dissolving of a man's blood means the dispersion of 
   that which might lead to bloodshed and wounds, i.e., avoidance of danger. 
    But here the thought is not that a man avoids difficulties for himself 
 alone,   but rather that he rescues his kin-helps them to get away before 
 danger comes,  or to keep at a distance from an existing danger, or to find 
 a way out of  a danger that is already upon them. In this way he does what 
 is right.</p>
