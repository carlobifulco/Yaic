<p>  above  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE<br>
          below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH</p>
                            
<p>  The hexagram represents the sun rising over the earth. It is therefore 
    the symbol of rapid, easy progress, which at the same time means ever 
widening    expansion and clarity.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  PROGRESS. The powerful prince<br>
          Is honored with horses in large numbers.<br>
          In a single day he is granted audience three times.</p>
                            
<p>  As an example of progress, this pictures a time when a powerful feudal 
    lord rallies the other lords around the sovereign and pledges fealty and
   peace. The sovereign rewards him richly and invites him to a closer intimacy.</p>
                            
<p>    A twofold idea is set forth here. The actual effect of the progress 
    emanates from a man who is in a dependent position and whom the others 
 regard   as their equal and are therefore willing to follow. This leader 
has enough   clarity of vision not to abuse his great influence but to use 
it rather for  the benefit of his ruler. His ruler in turn is free of all 
jealousy, showers  presents on the great man, and invites him continually 
to his court. An enlightened  ruler and an obedient servant--this is the condition
on which  great progress  depends.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  The sun rises over the earth:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of PROGRESS.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the superior man himself<br>
          Brightens his bright virtue.</p>
                            
<p>  The light of the sun rises over the earth is by nature clear. The higher
the sun rises, the more it emerges from the dark mists, spreading the pristine
purity of its rays over an ever widening area. The real nature of man is
likewise originally good, but it becomes clouded by contact with earthly
things and therefore needs purification before it can shine forth in its
native clarity.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  Progressing, but turned back.<br>
          Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
          If one meets with no confidence, one should remain calm.</p>
                            
<p>  No mistake.</p>
                            
<p>  At a time when all elements are pressing for progress, we are still 
   uncertain whether in the course of advance we may not meet with a rebuff. 
    Then the thing to do is simply continue in what is right; in the end this
    will bring good fortune. It may be that we meet with no confidence. In
 this   case we ought not to try to win confidence regardless of the situation, 
  but  should remain calm and cheerful and refuse to be roused to anger. Thus
  we  remain free of mistakes.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Progressing, but in sorrow.<br>
          Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Then one obtains great happiness from one's ancestress.</p>
                            
<p>  Progress is halted; an individual is kept from getting in touch with 
    the man in authority with whom he has a connection. When this happens, 
 he   must remain persevering, although he is grieved; then with a maternal 
 gentleness   the man in question will bestow great happiness upon him. This 
 happiness  comes to him-and is well deserved-because in this case mutual 
attraction does not rest on selfish or partisan motives but on firm and correct 
principles.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  All are in accord. Remorse disappears.</p>
                            
<p>  A man strives onward, in association with others whose backing encourages 
    him. This dispels any cause for regret over the fact that he does not 
have    enough independence to triumph unaided over every hostile turn of 
fate.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Progress like a hamster.<br>
          Perseverance brings danger.</p>
                            
<p>  In times of progress it is easy for strong men in the wrong places 
   to amass great possessions. But such conduct shuns the light. And since 
  times  of progress are inevitably brought to the light, perseverance in 
such  action  always leads to danger.<br>
           Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Remorse disappears.</p>
                            
<p>  Take not gain and loss to heart.<br>
          Undertakings bring good fortune.<br>
          Everything serves to further.</p>
                            
<p>  The situation described here is that of one who, finding himself in 
   an influential position in a time of progress, remains gentle and reserved. 
    He might reproach himself for lack of energy in making the most of the 
 propitiousness   of the time and obtaining all possible advantage. However, 
 this regret passes   away. He must not take either loss or gain to heart; 
 they are minor considerations.   What matters much more is the fact that 
in this way he has assured himself   of opportunities for successful and beneficent
influence.   </p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  Making progress with the horns is permissible<br>
          Only for the purpose of punishing one's own city.</p>
                            
<p>  To be conscious of danger brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  No blame. <br>
          Perseverance brings humiliation.</p>
                            
<p>  Making progress with lowered horns-i.e., acting on the offensive-is 
   permissible, in times like those referred to here, only in dealing with 
  the  mistakes of one's own people. Even then we must bear in mind that proceeding
    on the offensive may always be dangerous. In this way we avoid the mistakes
    that otherwise threaten, and succeed in what we set out to do. On the
other    hand, perseverance in such over energetic behavior, especially toward
persons    with whom there is no close connection, will lead to humiliation.</p>
