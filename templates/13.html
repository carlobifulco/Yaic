         13. T'ung J&ecirc;n / Fellowship with Men</b>                  
         </p>
<p>  above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN<br>
          below  LI  THE CLINGING, FLAME</p>
                            
<p>  The image of the upper trigram Ch'ien is heaven, and that of the lower, 
    Li, is flame. It is the nature of fire to flame up to the heaven. This 
 gives   the idea of fellowship. IT is the second line that, by virtue of 
its central   character, unites the five strong lines around it. This hexagram 
 forms a  complement to Shih, THE ARMY </p>
                            
<p>  <a

In the latter, danger is within and obedience without--the character of a
warlike army, which, in order to hold together, needs one strong man among
the many who are weak. Here, clarity is within and strength without--the
character of a peaceful union of men, which, in order to hold together, needs
one yielding nature among many firm persons.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN in the open.</p>
                            
<p>  Success.<br>
          It furthers one to cross the great water.<br>
          The perseverance of the superior man furthers.</p>
                            
<p>  True fellowship among men must be based upon a concern that is universal. 
    It is not the private interests of the individual that create lasting 
fellowship    among men, but rather the goals of humanity. That is why it 
is said that   fellowship with men in the open succeeds. If unity of this 
kind prevails,   even difficult and dangerous tasks, such as crossing the 
great water, can   be accomplished. But in order to bring about this sort 
of fellowship, a persevering  and enlightened leader is needed--a man with 
clear, convincing, and inspiring  aims and the strength to carry them out. 
(The inner trigram means clarity;  the outer, strength.)</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Heaven together with fire:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of FELLOWSHIP WITH MEN.<br>
          Thus the superior man organizes the clans<br>
          And makes distinctions between things.</p>
                            
<p>  Heaven has the same direction of movement as fire, yet it is different 
    from fire. Just as the luminaries in the sky serve for the systematic 
division    and arrangement of time, so human society and all things that 
really belong    together must be organically arranged. Fellowship should 
not be a mere mingling   of individuals or of things--that would be chaos, 
not fellowship. If fellowship   is to lead to order, there must be organization 
within diversity.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  Fellowship with men at the gate.<br>
          No blame.</p>
                            
<p>  The beginning of union among people should take place before the door. 
    All are equally close to one another. No divergent aims have yet arisen, 
   and one makes not mistakes. The basic principles of any kind of union must
   be equally accessible to all concerned. Secret agreements bring misfortune.<br>
           Six in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Fellowship with men in the clan.<br>
          Humiliation.</p>
                            
<p>  There is danger here of formation of a separate faction on the basis 
    of personal and egotistic interests. Such factions, which are exclusive 
  and,  instead of welcoming all men, must condemn one group in order to unite
  the  others, originate from low motives and therefore lead in the course
 of time  to humiliation.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  He hides weapons in the thicket;<br>
          He climbs the high hill in front of it.<br>
          For three years he does not rise up.</p>
                            
<p>  Here fellowship has changed about to mistrust. Each man distrusts the
other, plans a secret ambush, and seeks to spy on his fellow form afar. We
are dealing with an obstinate opponent whom we cannot come at by this method.
Obstacles standing in the way of fellowship with others are shown here. One
has mental reservations for one's own part and seeks to take his opponent
by surprise. This very fact makes one mistrustful, suspecting the same wiles
in his opponent and trying to ferret them out. The result is that one departs
further and further from true fellowship. The longer this goes on, the more
alienated one becomes.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  He climbs up on his wall; he cannot attack.<br>
          Good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Here the reconciliation that follows quarrel mover nearer. It is true 
    that there are still dividing walls on which we stand confronting one 
another.    But the difficulties are too great. We get into straits, and this
brings   us to our senses. We cannot fight, and therein lies our good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>   Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Men bound in fellowship first weep and lament,<br>
          But afterward they laugh.<br>
          After great struggles they succeed in meeting.</p>
                            
<p>  Two people are outwardly separated, but in their hearts they are united. 
    They are kept apart by their positions in life. Many difficulties and 
obstructions    arise between them and cause them grief. But, remaining true 
to each other,    the allow nothing to separate them, and although it costs 
them a severe  struggle  to overcome the obstacles, they will succeed. When 
they come together  their  sadness will change to joy. Confucius says of this:</p>
                            
<p>  Life leads the thoughtful man on a path of many windings.Now the course 
    is checked, now it runs straight again.Here winged thoughts may pour freely
    forth in words,There the heavy burden of knowledge must be shut away
in   silence.But  when two people are at one in the inmost hearts,They shatter
  even the strength  of iron or of bronze.And when two people understand each
  other in their inmost  hearts,Their words are sweet and strong, like the
 fragrance of orchids.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  Fellowship with men in the meadow.<br>
          No remorse.</p>
                            
<p>  The warm attachment that springs from the heart is lacking here. We 
   are by this time actually outside of fellowship with others. However, we
  ally ourselves with them. The fellowship does not include all, but only 
 those  who happen to dwell near one another. The meadow is the pasture at 
 the entrance   to the town. At this stage, the ultimate goal of the union 
 of mankind has   not yet been attained, but we need not reproach ourselves. 
 We join the community   without separate aims of our own. </p>
