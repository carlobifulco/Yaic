         32. H&ecirc;ng / Duration</b>                            </p>
<p>  above  CHEN  THE AROUSING, THUNDER<br>
          below  SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND</p>
                            
<p>  The strong trigram Ch&ecirc;n is above, the weak trigram Sun below. 
   This hexagram is the inverse of the preceding one. In the latter we have 
   influence, here we have union as an enduring condition. The two images 
are   thunder and wind, which are likewise constantly paired phenomena. The 
lower   trigram indicates gentleness within; the upper, movement without. 
 In the   sphere of social relationships, the hexagram represents the institution 
 of  marriage as the enduring union of the sexes. During courtship the young 
 man  subordinates himself to the girl, but in marriage, which is represented 
 by  the coming together of the eldest son and the eldest daughter, the husband 
   is the directing and moving force outside, while the wife, inside, is gentle
   and submissive.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  DURATION. Success. No blame.<br>
          Perseverance furthers.<br>
          It furthers one to have somewhere to go.</p>
                            
<p>  Duration is a state whose movement is not worn down by hindrances. 
   It is not a state of rest, for mere standstill is regression. Duration 
 is   rather the self-contained and therefore self-renewing movement of an 
 organized,   firmly integrated whole, taking place in accordance with immutable 
 laws and  beginning anew at every ending. The end is reached by an inward 
 movement,   by inhalation, systole, contraction, and this movement turns 
into a new beginning,  in which the movement is directed outward, in exhalation, 
 diastole, expansion.   Heavenly bodies exemplify duration. They move in their
 fixed orbits, and  because of this their light-giving power endures. The
seasons of the year  follow a fixed law of change and transformation, hence
can produce effects  that endure.  So likewise the dedicated man embodies 
an enduring meaning in his way of life, and thereby the world is formed. In
that which gives things their duration, we can come to understand the nature
of all beings in heaven and on earth.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Thunder and wind: the image of DURATION.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the superior man stands firm <br>
          And does not change has direction.</p>
                            
<p>  Thunder rolls, and the wind blows; both are examples of extreme mobility 
    and so are seemingly the very opposite of duration, but the laws governing 
    their appearance and subsidence, their coming and going, endure. In the 
  same  way the independence of the superior man is not based on rigidity 
and  immobility  of character. He always keeps abreast of the time and changes 
  with it. What  endures is the unswerving directive, the inner law of his 
 being, which determines  all his actions.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  Seeking duration too hastily brings misfortune persistently.</p>
                            
<p>  Nothing that would further.</p>
                            
<p>  Whatever endures can be created only gradually by long-continued work 
    and careful reflection. In the same sense Lao-tse says: "If we wish to 
 compress   something, we must first let it fully expand." He who demands 
too much at   once is acting precipitately, and because he attempts too much, 
 he ends by  succeeding in nothing.<br>
           Nine in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Remorse disappears.<br>
           The situation is abnormal. A man's force of character is greater 
 than   the available material power. Thus he might be afraid of allowing 
himself   to attempt something beyond his strength. However, since it is the
time of  DURATION, it is possible for him to control his inner strength and
so to avoid excess. Cause for remorse then disappears.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  He who does not give duration to his character<br>
          Meets with disgrace.<br>
          Persistent humiliation.</p>
                            
<p>  If a man remains at the mercy of moods of hope or fear aroused by the
outer world, he loses his inner consistency of character. Such inconsistency 
    invariably leads to distressing experiences. These humiliations often 
come    from an unforeseen quarter. Such experiences are not merely effects 
produced    by the external world, but logical consequences evoked by his 
own nature.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  No game in the field.</p>
                            
<p>  If we are in pursuit of game and want to get a shot at a quarry, we 
   must set about it in the right way. A man who persists in stalking game 
  in  a place where there is none may wait forever without finding any. Persistence 
    in search is not enough. What is not sought in the right way is not found.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Giving duration to one's character through perseverance.</p>
                            
<p>  This is good fortune for a woman, misfortune for a man.</p>
                            
<p>  A woman should follow a man her whole life long, but a man should at
all times hold to what is his duty at the given moment. Should he persistently 
    seek to conform to the woman, it would be a mistake for him. Accordingly 
   it is altogether right for a woman to hold conservatively to tradition, 
 but  a  man must always be flexible and adaptable and allow himself to be 
 guided   solely by what his duty requires of him at the moment.</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  Restlessness as an enduring condition brings misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  There are people who live in a state of perpetual hurry without ever 
    attaininginner composure. Restlessness not only prevents all thoroughness 
    but actuallybecomes a danger if it is dominant in places of authority.</p>
