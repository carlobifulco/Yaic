Power of the Great</b>                            </p>
<p>  above  CH&ecirc;N  THE AROUSING, THUNDER</p>
                            
<p>  above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN</p>
                            
<p>  The great lines, that is, the light, strong lines, are powerful. Four 
    light lines have entered the hexagram from below and are about to ascend 
   higher. The upper trigram is Ch&ecirc;n, the Arousing; the lower is ch'ien, 
   the Creative. Ch'ien is strong, Ch&ecirc;n produces movement. The union 
 of  movement and strength gives the meaning of THE POWER OF THE GREAT. The 
 hexagram  is linked with the second month (March-April).</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  THE POWER OF THE GREAT. Perseverance furthers.</p>
                            
<p>  The hexagram points to a time when inner worth mounts with great force 
    and comes to power. But its strength has already passed beyond the median 
    line, hence there is danger that one may rely entirely on one's own power 
    and forget to ask what is right. There is danger too that, being intent 
  on  movement, we may not wait for the right time. Therefore the added statement 
    that perseverance furthers. For that is truly great power which does not
   degenerate into mere force but remains inwardly united with the fundamental 
   principles of right and of justice. When we understand this point--namely, 
   that greatness and justice must be indissolubly united--we understand the
   true meaning of all that happens in heaven and on earth.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Thunder in heaven above:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of THE POWER OF THE GREAT.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the superior man does not tread upon paths</p>
                            
<p>  That do not accord with established order.</p>
                            
<p>  Thunder--electrical energy--mounts upward in the spring. The direction 
    of this movement is in harmony with that of the movement of heaven. It 
 is   therefore a movement in accord with heaven, producing great power. However,
    true greatness depends on being in harmony with what is right. Therefore
   in times of great power the superior man avoids doing anything that is
not   in harmony with the established order.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  Power in the toes.<br>
          Continuing brings misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  This is certainly true.</p>
                            
<p>  The toes are in the lowest place and are ready to advance. So likewise 
    great power in lowly station is inclined to effect advance by force. This,
    if carried further, would certainly lead to misfortune, and therefore 
by   way of advice a warning is added.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  The premise here is that the gates to success are beginning to open. 
    Resistance gives way and we forge ahead. This is the point at which, only
    too easily, we become the prey of exuberant self-confidence. This is
why    the oracle says that perseverance (i.e., perseverance in inner equilibrium,
   without excessive use of power) brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The inferior man works through power.</p>
                            
<p>  The superior man does not act thus.</p>
                            
<p>  To continue is dangerous.<br>
          A goat butts against a hedge<br>
          And gets its horns entangled.</p>
                            
<p>  Making a boast of power leads to entanglements, just as a goat entangles 
    its horns when it butts against a hedge. Whereas an inferior man revels 
  in  power when he comes into possession of it, the superior man never makes 
  this  mistake. He is conscious at all times of the danger of pushing ahead 
  regardless  of circumstances, and therefore renounces in good time the empty
  display of force.<br>
           Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
          Remorse disappears.</p>
                            
<p>  The hedge opens; there is no entanglement.<br>
          Power depends upon the axle of a big cart.</p>
                            
<p>  If a man goes on quietly and perseveringly working at the removal of
resistances, success comes in the end. The obstructions give way and all occasion
for remorse arising from excessive use of power disappears.</p>
                            
<p>  Such a man's power does not show externally, yet it can move heavy 
   loads, like a big cart whose real strength lies in its axle. The less that
   power is applied outwardly, the greater its effect.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Loses the goat with ease.</p>
                            
<p>  No remorse.</p>
                            
<p>  The goat is noted for hardness outwardly and weakness within. Now the
situation is such that everything is easy; there is no more resistance. One
can give up a belligerent, stubborn way of acting and will not have to regret
it.</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  A goat butts against a hedge.<br>
          It cannot go backward, it cannot go forward.</p>
                            
<p>  Nothing serves to further.<br>
          If one notes the difficulty, this brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  If we venture too far we come to a deadlock, unable either to advance 
    or to retreat and whatever we do merely serves to complicate thing further. 
    Such obstinacy leads to insuperable difficulties. But if, realizing the 
  situation,  we compose ourselves and decide not to continue, everything 
will  right itself  in time.</p>
