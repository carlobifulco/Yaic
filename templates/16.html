         16. Y&uuml; / Enthusiasm</b>                            </p>
<p>  above  CH&ecirc;N  THE AROUSING, THUNDER<br>
          below  K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH</p>
                            
<p>  The strong line in the fourth place, that of the leading official, 
   meets with response and obedience from all the other lines, which are all
   weak. The attribute of the upper trigram, Ch&ecirc;n, is movement; the
attributes   of K'un, the lower, are obedience and devotion. This begins a
movement that   meets with devotion and therefore inspires enthusiasm, carrying
all with  it. Of great importance, furthermore, is the law of movement along
the line  of least resistance, which in this hexagram is enunciated as the
law for natural events and for human life.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  ENTHUSIASM. It furthers one to install helpers<br>
          And to set armies marching.</p>
                            
<p>   The time of ENTHUSIASM derives from the fact that there is at hand 
   an eminent man who is in sympathy with the spirit of the people and acts 
   in accord with it. Hence he finds universal and willing obedience. To arouse
    enthusiasm it is necessary for a man to adjust himself and his ordinances
    to the character of those whom he has to lead. The inviolability of natural
    laws rests on this principle of movement along the line of least resistance.
    Theses laws are not forces external to things but represent the harmony
  of  movement immanent in them. That is why the celestial bodies do not
deviate     from their orbits and why all events in nature occur with fixed
regularity.     It is the same with human society: only such laws are rooted
in popular   sentiment  can be enforced, while laws violating this sentiment
merely arouse   resentment.   Again, it is enthusiasm that enables us to
install helpers  for the completion  of an undertaking without fear of secret
opposition. It is enthusiasm too  that can unify mass movements, as in war,
so that they  achieve victory.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Thunder comes resounding out of the earth:<br>
          The image of ENTHUSIASM.<br>
          Thus the ancient kings made music <br>
          In order to honor merit,<br>
          And offered it with splendor<br>
          To the Supreme Deity,<br>
          Inviting their ancestors to be present.</p>
                            
<p>  When, at the beginning of summer, thunder--electrical energy--comes 
   rushing forth from the earth again, and the first thunderstorm refreshes 
   nature, a prolonged state of tension is resolved. Joy and relief make themselves
   felt. So too, music has power to ease tension within the heart and to
loosen    the grip of obscure emotions. The enthusiasm of the heart expresses
itself    involuntarily in a burst of song, in dance and rhythmic movement
of the  body.  From immemorial times the inspiring effect of the invisible
sound that moves  all hearts, and draws them together, has mystified mankind.
 Rulers have made use of this natural taste for music; they elevated and
regulated  it. Music was looked upon as something serious and holy, designed 
to purify  the feelings of men. It fell to music to glorify the virtues of 
heroes and  thus to construct a bridge to the world of the unseen. In the 
temple men drew near to God with music and pantomimes (out of this later the
theater developed). Religious feeling for the Creator of the world was united
with the most sacred of human feelings, that of reverence for the ancestors.
The ancestors were invited to these divine services as guests of the Ruler
of Heaven and as representatives of humanity in the higher regions. This
uniting of the human past with the Divinity in solemn moments of religious 
inspiration established the bond between God and man. The ruler who revered 
the Divinity in revering his ancestors became thereby the Son of Heaven, in
whom the heavenly and the earthly world met in mystical contact.  These ideas
are the final summation of Chinese culture. Confucius has said of the great
sacrifice at which these rites were performed: "He who could wholly comprehend
this sacrifice could rule the world as though it were spinning on his hand."</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  Enthusiasm that expresses itself<br>
          Brings misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  A man in an inferior position has aristocratic connections about which 
    he boasts enthusiastically. This arrogance inevitably invites misfortune.<br>
          Enthusiasm should never be an egotistic emotion; it is justified
 only   when  it is a general feeling that unites one with others.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Firm as a rock. Not a whole day.<br>
          Perseverance brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  This describes a person who does not allow himself to be misled by 
   any illusions. While others are letting themselves be dazzled by enthusiasm, 
    he recognizes with perfect clarity the first signs of the time. Thus he
  neither  flatters those above nor neglects those beneath him; he is as
firm   as a rock.  When the first sign of discord appears, he knows the right
moment   for withdrawing  and does not delay even for a day. Perseverance 
in such  conduct will bring  good fortune. Confucius says about this line:</p>
                            
<p>  To know the seeds, that is divine indeed. In his association with those
above him, the superior man does not flatter. In his association with those
beneath him, he is not arrogant. For he knows the seeds. The seeds are the
first imperceptible beginning of movement, the first trace of good fortune
(or misfortune) that shows itself. The superior man perceives the seeds and
immediately takes actin. He does not wait even a whole day. In the Book of
Changes it is said: "Firm as a rock. Not a whole day. Perseverance brings
good fortune."</p>
                            
<p>  Firm as a rock, what need of a whole day?</p>
                            
<p>.  The judgment can be known.</p>
                            
<p>.  The superior man knows what is hidden and what is evident.<br>
          He knows weakness, he knows strength as well.<br>
          Hence the myriads look up to him.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Enthusiasm that looks upward creates remorse.<br>
          Hesitation brings remorse.</p>
                            
<p>  This line is the opposite of the preceding one: the latter bespeaks 
   self-reliance, while here there is enthusiastic looking up to a leader. 
  If  a man hesitates too long, this also will bring remorse. The right moment 
   for approach must be seized: only then will he do the right thing.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The source of enthusiasm.<br>
          He achieves great things.<br>
          Doubt not.<br>
          You gather friends around you<br>
          As a hair clasp gathers the hair.</p>
                            
<p>  This describes a man who is able to awaken enthusiasm through his own
sureness and freedom from hesitation. He attracts people because he has no
doubts and is wholly sincere. Owing to his confidence in them he wins their
enthusiastic co-operation and attains success. Just as a clasp draws the
hair together and hold it, so he draws man together by the support he gives
them.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Persistently ill, and still does not die.</p>
                            
<p>  Here enthusiasm is obstructed. A man is under constant pressure, which 
    prevents him from breathing freely. However, this pressure has its advantage--it 
    prevents him from consuming his powers in empty enthusiasm. Thus constant 
    pressure can actually serve to keep one alive.</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the top means:<br>
          Deluded enthusiasm.<br>
          But if after completion one changes, <br>
          There is no blame.</p>
                            
<p>  It is a bad thing for a man to let himself be deluded by enthusiasm. 
    But if this delusion has run its course, and he is still capable of changing, 
    then he is freed of error. A sober awakening from false enthusiasm is 
quite    possible and very favorable.</p>
