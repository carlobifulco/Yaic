         27. I / Corners of the Mouth (Providing Nourishment)</b>       
                    </p>
<p>  above  K&ecirc;N  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN<br>
          below  CH&ecirc;N  THE AROUSING, THUNDER</p>
                            
<p>  This hexagram is a picture of an open mouth; above and below are firm 
    lines of the lips, and between them the opening. Starting with the mouth, 
    through which we take food for nourishment, the thought leads to nourishment 
    itself. Nourishment of oneself, specifically of the body, is represented 
   in the three lower lines, while the three upper lines represent nourishment 
   and care of others, in a higher, spiritual sense.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH.<br>
          Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
          Pay heed to the providing of nourishment<br>
          And to what a man seeks</p>
                            
<p>  To fill his own mouth with.</p>
                            
<p>  In bestowing care and nourishment, it is important that the right people
should be taken care of and that we should attend to our own nourishment in
the right way. If we wish to know what anyone is like, we have only to observe
on whom he bestows his care and what sides of his own nature he cultivates 
    and nourishes. Nature nourishes all creatures. The great man fosters and
   takes care of superior men, in order to take care of all men through them.
   Mencius says about this:</p>
                            
<p>  If we wish to know whether anyone is superior or not, we need only 
   observe what part of his being he regards as especially important. The 
 body   has superior and inferior, important and unimportant parts. We must 
 not injure  important parts for the sake of the unimportant, nor must we 
injure the superior  parts for the sake of the inferior. He who cultivates 
the inferior  parts of his nature is an inferior man. He who cultivates the 
superior parts  of his nature is a superior man.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  At the foot of the mountain, thunder:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of PROVIDING NOURISHMENT.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the superior man is careful of his words<br>
          And temperate in eating and drinking.</p>
                            
<p>  "God comes forth in the sign of the Arousing": when in the spring the
life forces stir again, all things comes into being anew. "He brings to perfection
in the sign of Keeping Still": thus in the early spring, when the seeds fall
to earth, all things are made ready. This is an image of providing nourishment
through movement and tranquillity.  The superior man takes it as a pattern
for the nourishment and cultivation of his character. Words are a movement
going form within outward. Eating and drinking are movements from without
inward. Both kinds of movement can be modified by tranquillity. For tranquillity
keeps the words that come out of the mouth from exceeding proper measure,
and keeps the food that goes into the mouth from exceeding its proper measure.
Thus character is cultivated.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  You let your magic tortoise go,<br>
          And look at me with the corners of your mouth drooping.<br>
          Misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  The magic tortoise is a creature possessed of such supernatural powers 
    that it lives on air and needs no earthly nourishment. The image means 
 that   a man fitted by nature and position to live freely and independently 
 renounces   this self-reliance and instead looks with envy and discontent 
 at others who  are outwardly in better circumstances. But such base envy 
only arouses derision  and contempt in those others. This has bad results.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Turning to the summit for nourishment,<br>
          Deviating from the path</p>
                            
<p>  To seek nourishment from the hill.<br>
          Continuing to do this brings misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Normally a person either provides his own means of nourishment or is
supported in a proper way by those whose duty of privilege it is to provide 
    for him. If, owing to weakness of spirit, a man cannot support himself, 
  a  feeling of uneasiness comes over him; this is because in shirking the 
 proper  way of obtaining a living, he accepts support as a favor from those 
 in higher  place. This is unworthy, for he is deviating from his true nature. 
 Kept up  indefinitely, this course leads to misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Turning away from nourishment.<br>
          Perseverance brings misfortune.<br>
          Do not act thus for ten years.</p>
                            
<p>  Nothing serves to further.<br>
          </p>
                            
<p>  He who seeks nourishment that does not nourish reels from desire to 
   gratification and in gratification craves desire. Mad pursuit of pleasure 
    for the satisfaction of the senses never brings one to the goal. One should
    never (ten years is a complete cycle of time) follow this path, for nothing
    good can come of it.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Turning to the summit<br>
          For provision of nourishment<br>
          Brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Spying about with sharp eyes<br>
          Like a tiger with insatiable craving.</p>
                            
<p>  No blame.</p>
                            
<p>  In contrast to the six in the second place, which refers to a man bent
exclusively on his own advantage, this line refers to one occupying a high
position and striving to let his light sine forth. To do this he needs helpers,
because he cannot attain his lofty aim alone. With the greed of a hungry
tiger he is on the lookout for the right people. Since he is not working
for himself but for the good of all, there is no wrong in such zeal.<br>
           Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Turning away from the path.</p>
                            
<p>  To remain persevering brings good fortune.<br>
          One should not cross the great water.</p>
                            
<p>  A man may be conscious of a deficiency in himself. He should be undertaking 
    the nourishment of the people, but he has not the strength to do it. Thus
    he must turn from his accustomed path and beg counsel and help from a
man    who is spiritually his superior but undistinguished outwardly. If he
maintains    this attitude of mind perseveringly, success and good fortune 
are his. But   he must remain aware of his dependence. He must not put his 
own person forward   nor attempt great labors, such as crossing the great 
water.<br>
           Nine at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  The source of nourishment.<br>
          Awareness of danger brings good fortune.<br>
          It furthers one to cross the great water.</p>
                            
<p>  This describes a sage of the highest order, from whom emanate all influences
that provide nourishment for others. Such a position brings with it heavy
responsibility. If he remains conscious of this fact, he has good fortune
and may confidently undertake even great and difficult labors, such as crossing
the great water. These undertakings bring general happiness for him and for
all others.</p>
