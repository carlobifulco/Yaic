<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  THE MARRYING MAIDEN.<br>
          Undertakings bring misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Nothing that would further.</p>
                            
<p>  A girl who is taken into the family, but not as the chief wife, must 
    behave with special caution and reserve. She must not take it upon herself 
    to supplant the mistress of the house, for that would mean disorder and 
  lead  to untenable relationships.  The same is true of all voluntary relationships 
    between human beings. While legally regulated relationships based on personal
    inclination depend in the long run entirely on tactful reserve.  Affection
    as the essential principle of relatedness is of the greatest importance
  in  all relationships in the world. For the union of heaven and earth is
 the origin of the whole of nature. Among human beings likewise, spontaneous
 affection  is the all-inclusive principle of union.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Thunder over the lake:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of THE MARRYING MAIDEN.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the superior man<br>
          Understands the transitory<br>
          In the light of the eternity of the end.</p>
                            
<p>  Thunder stirs the water of the lake, which follows it in shimmering 
   waves. This symbolizes the girl who follows the man of her choice. But 
 every   relationship between individuals bears within it the danger that 
wrong turns   may be taken, leading to endless misunderstandings and disagreements. 
  Therefore   it is necessary constantly to remain mindful of the end. If 
we  permit ourselves   to drift along, we come together and are parted again 
 as the day may determine.   If on the other hand a man fixes his mind on 
an end that endures, he will   succeed in avoiding the reefs that confront 
the closer relationships of people.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  The marrying maiden as a concubine.<br>
          A lame man who is able to tread.<br>
          Undertakings bring good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  The princess of ancient China maintained a fixed order of rank among 
    the court ladies, who were subordinated to the queen as are younger sisters 
    to the eldest. Frequently they came from the family of the queen, who 
herself    led them to her husband.  The meaning is that a girl entering a
family with   the consent of the wife will not rank outwardly as the equal 
of the latter   but will withdraw modestly into the background. However, if
she understands   how to fit herself into the pattern of things, her position 
 will be entirely   satisfactory, and she will feel sheltered in the love 
of the husband to whom  she bears children.  The same meaning is brought out
in the relationships   between officials. A man may enjoy the personal friendship
of a prince and   be taken into his confidence. Outwardly this man must keep
tactfully in the  background behind the official ministers of state, but,
although he is hampered  by this status, as if he were lame, he can nevertheless
accomplish something  through the kindliness of his nature.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  A one-eyed man who is able to see.</p>
                            
<p>  The perseverance of a solitary man furthers.</p>
                            
<p>  Here the situation is that of a girl married to a man who has disappointed 
    her. Man and wife ought to work together like a pair of eyes. Here the 
 girl   is left behind in loneliness; the man of her choice either has become 
 unfaithful   or has died. But she does not lost the inner light of loyalty. 
 Thought the   other eye is gone, she maintains her loyalty even in loneliness.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The marrying maiden as a slave.</p>
                            
<p>  She marries as a concubine.</p>
                            
<p>  A girl who is in a lowly position and finds no husband may, in some 
   circumstances, still win shelter as a concubine.  This pictures the situation 
    of a person who longs too much for joys that cannot be obtained in the 
 usual   way. He enters upon a situation not altogether compatible with self-esteem. 
    Neither judgment nor warning is added to this line; it merely lays bare 
  the  actual situation, so that everyone may draw a lesson from it.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The marrying maiden draws out the allotted time.<br>
          A late marriage comes in due course.</p>
                            
<p>  The girl is virtuous. She does not wish to throw herself away, and 
   allows the customary time for marriage to slip by. However, there is no
  harm  in this; she is rewarded for her purity and, even though belatedly, 
  finds  the husband intended for her.</p>
                            
<p>  <br>
           Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The sovereign I gave his daughter in marriage.</p>
                            
<p>  The embroidered garments of the princess<br>
          Were not as gorgeous<br>
          As those of the serving maid.</p>
                            
<p>  The moon that is nearly full<br>
          Brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  The sovereign I is T'ang the Completer. This ruler decreed that the 
   imperial princesses should be subordinated to their husbands in the same 
   manner as other women (cf. Hexagram </p>
                            
<p>  <a
 href="file:///c:/All_my_docs/YAIC/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#11">11</a>,
six in the fifth place). The emperor does not     wait for a suitor to woo
his daughter but gives her in marriage when he   sees  fit. Therefore it
is in accord with custom for the girl's family to   take the initiative here.
 We see here a girl of aristocratic birth who marries   a man of modest circumstances
and understands how to adapt herself with grace   to the new situation. She
is free of all vanity of outer adornment,  and forgetting  her rank in her
marriage, takes a place below that of her  husband, just as  the moon, before
it is quite full, does not directly face  the sun.</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  The woman holds the basket, but there are no fruits in it.</p>
                            
<p>  The man stabs the sheep, but no blood flows.</p>
                            
<p>  Nothing that acts to further.</p>
                            
<p>  At the sacrifice to the ancestors, the woman had to present harvest 
   offerings in a basket, while the man slaughtered the sacrificial animal 
  with  his own hand. Here the ritual is only superficially fulfilled; the 
 woman takes an empty basket and the man stabs a sheep slaughtered beforehand-solely 
   to preserve the forms. This impious, irreverent attitude bodes no good 
for   a marriage.</p>
