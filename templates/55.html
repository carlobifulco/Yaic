         55. F&ecirc;ng / Abundance [Fullness]</b>                      
     </p>
<p>  above  CH&ecirc;N  THE AROUSING, THUNDER<br>
          below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE</p>
                            
<p>  Ch&ecirc;n is movement; Li is flame, whose attribute is clarity. Clarity 
    within, movement without-this produces greatness and abundance. The hexagram 
    pictures a period of advanced civilization. However, the fact that development 
    has reached a peak suggests that this extraordinary condition of abundance 
    cannot be maintained permanently.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  ABUNDANCE has success.</p>
                            
<p>  The king attains abundance.<br>
          Be not sad.<br>
          Be like the sun at midday.</p>
                            
<p>  It is not given to every mortal to bring about a time of outstanding 
    greatness and abundance. Only a born ruler of men is able to do it, because 
    his will is directed to what is great. Such a time of abundance is usually 
    brief. Therefore a sage might well feel sad in view of the decline that 
  must  follow. But such sadness foes not befit him. Only a man who is inwardly 
  free  of sorrow and care can lead in a time of abundance. He must be like 
  the sun  at midday, illuminating and gladdening everything under heaven.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Both thunder and lightning come:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of ABUNDANCE.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the superior man decides lawsuits<br>
          And carries out punishments.</p>
                            
<p>  This hexagram has a certain connection with Shih Ho, BITING THROUGH 
     </p>
                            
<p>  <a
 href="file:///c:/All_my_docs/YAIC/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#21">21</a>,
in which thunder and lightning similarly appear     together, but in the
reverse order. In BITING THROUGH, laws are laid down;     here they are applied
and enforced. Clarity [Li] within makes it possible     to investigate the
facts exactly, and shock [Ch&ecirc;n] without ensures    a strict and precise
carrying out of punishments.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  When a man meets his destined ruler,</p>
                            
<p>  They can be together ten days,<br>
          And it is not a mistake.<br>
          Going meets with recognition.</p>
                            
<p>  To bring about a time of abundance, a union of clarity with energetic 
    movement is needed. Two individuals possessed of these two attributes 
are    suited to each other, and even if they spend an entire cycle of time 
together    during the period of abundance, it will not be too long, nor is
it a mistake.    Therefore one may go forth, in order to make one's influence 
felt; it will    meet with recognition.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The curtain is of such fullness</p>
                            
<p>  That the polestars can be seen at noon.</p>
                            
<p>  Through going one meets with mistrust and hate.<br>
          If one rouses him through truth,<br>
          Good fortune comes.</p>
                            
<p>  It often happens that plots and party intrigues, which have the darkening 
    effect of an eclipse of the sun, come between a ruler intent on great 
achievement    and the man who could effect great undertakings. Then, instead 
of the sun,    we see the northern stars in the sky. The ruler is overshadowed 
by a party    that has usurped power. If a man at such a time were to try 
to take energetic    measures, he would encounter only mistrust and envy, 
which would prohibit    all movement. The essential thing then is to hold 
inwardly to the power  of  truth, which in the end is so strong that it exerts 
an invisible influence    on the ruler, so that all goes well.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The underbrush is of such abundance</p>
                            
<p>  That the small stars can be seen at noon.<br>
          He breaks his right arm . No blame.</p>
                            
<p>  The image is that of a progressive covering over of the sun.  Here 
   the eclipse reaches totality, therefore even the small stars can be seen 
   at noon.  In the sphere of social relationships, this means that the prince 
   is now so eclipsed that even the most insignificant persons can push themselves 
    into the foreground. This makes it impossible for an able man, though 
he   might be the right hand of the ruler, to undertake anything. It is as 
though   his arm were broken, but he is not to blame for being thus hindered 
in action.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The curtain is of such fullness</p>
                            
<p>  That the polestars can be seen at noon.<br>
          He meets his ruler, who is of like kind.<br>
          Good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Here the darkness is already decreasing, therefore interrelated elements 
    come together. Here too the complement must be found-the necessary wisdom 
    to complement joy of action. Then everything will go well. The complementary 
    factor postulated here is the reverse of the one in the first line. In 
 the   latter, wisdom is to be complemented by energy, while here energy is
 complemented   by wisdom.<br>
           Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Lines are coming,<br>
          Blessing and fame draw near.<br>
          Good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  The ruler is modest and therefore open to the counsel of able men. 
   Thus he is surrounded by men who suggest to him the lines of action. This
    brings blessing, fame, and good fortune to him and all the people.</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  His house is in a state of abundance.<br>
          He screens off his family.<br>
          He peers through the gate<br>
          And no longer perceives anyone.<br>
          For three years he sees nothing.<br>
          Misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  This describes a man who because of his arrogance and obstinacy attains 
    the opposite of what he strives for. He seeks abundance and splendor for
   his dwelling. He wishes at all odds to be master in his house, which so
 alienates   his family that in the end he finds himself completely isolated.</p>
