         26. Ta Ch'u / The Taming Power of the Great</b>                
           </p>
<p>  above  K&ecirc;N  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN<br>
          below  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN</p>
                            
<p>  The Creative is tamed by K&ecirc;n, Keeping Still.  This produces great
power, a situation in contrast to that of the ninth hexagram, Hsiao Ch'u,
THE TAMING POWER OF THE SMALL, in which the Creative is tamed by the Gentle
alone. There one weak line must tame five strong lines, but here four strong
lines are restrained by two weak lines; in addition to a minister, there
is a prince, and the restraining power therefore is afar stronger.  The hexagram
has a threefold meaning, expressing different aspects of the concept "Holding
firm." Heaven within the mountain gives the idea of holding firm in the sense
of holding together; the trigram K&ecirc;n which holds the trigram ch'ien
still, gives the idea of holding firm in the sense of holding back; the third
idea is that of holding firm in the sense of caring for and nourishing. This
last is suggested by the fact that a strong line at the top, which is the
ruler of the hexagram, is honored and tended as a sage. The third of these
meanings also attaches specifically to this strong line at the top, which
represents the sage.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.<br>
          Perseverance furthers.</p>
                            
<p>  Not eating at home brings good fortune.<br>
          It furthers one to cross the great water.</p>
                            
<p>  To hold firmly to great creative powers and store them up, as set forth
in this hexagram, there is need of a strong, clear-headed man who is honored
by the ruler. The trigram Ch'ein points to strong creative power; K&ecirc;n
indicates firmness and truth. Both point to light and clarity and to the
daily renewal of character. Only through such daily self-renewal can a man
continue at the height of his powers. Force of habit helps to keep order
in quiet times; but in periods when there is a great storing up of energy,
everything depends on the power of the personality. However, since the worthy
are honored, as in the case of the strong personality entrusted with leadership
by the ruler, it is an advantage not to eat at home but rather to earn one's
bread by entering upon public office. Such a man is in harmony with heaven;
therefore even great and difficult undertakings, such as crossing the great
water, succeed.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Heaven within the mountain:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of THE TAMING POWER OF THE GREAT.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the superior man acquaints himself with many sayings of antiquity<br>
          And many deeds of the past,<br>
          In order to strengthen his character thereby.</p>
                            
<p>  Heaven within the mountain points to hidden treasures. In the words 
   and deeds of the past there lies hidden a treasure that men may use to 
 strengthen   and elevate their own characters. The way to study the past 
is not to confine   oneself to mere knowledge of history but, through application 
 of this knowledge,   to give actuality to the past.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  Danger is at hand. It furthers one to desist.</p>
                            
<p>  A man wishes to make vigorous advance, but circumstances present an 
   obstacle. He sees himself held back firmly. If he should attempt to fore 
   an advance, it would lead him into misfortune. Therefore it is better for
   him to compose himself and to wait until an outlet is offered for release
   of his stored-up energies.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The axletrees are taken from the wagon.</p>
                            
<p>  Here advance is checked just as in the third line of THE TAMING POWER 
    OF THE SMALL </p>
                            
<p>  <a
 href="file:///c:/All_my_docs/YAIC/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#9">9</a>.
However, in the later the restraining force is     slight; thus a conflict
arises between the propulsive and the restraining     movement, as a result
of which the spokes fall out of the wagon wheels,   while  here the restraining
force is absolutely superior; hence no struggle   takes  place. One submits
and removes the axletrees from the wagon -in other   words,  contents himself
with waiting. In this way energy accumulates for   a vigorous  advance later
on.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the third place means.<br>
          A good horse that follows others.<br>
          Awareness of danger,<br>
          With perseverance, furthers.<br>
          Practice chariot driving and armed defense daily. <br>
          It furthers one to have somewhere to go.</p>
                            
<p>  The way opens; the hindrance has been cleared away. A man is in contact 
    with a strong will acting in the same direction as his own, and goes forward
    like one good horse following another. But danger still threatens, and
 he   must remain aware of it, or he will be robbed of his firmness. Thus
he must   acquire skill on the one hand in what will take him forward, and
on the other  in what will protect him against unforeseen attacks. It is
good in such a  pass to have a goal toward which to strive.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The headboard of a young bull.<br>
          Great good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  This line and the one following it are the two that tame the forward-pushing 
    lower lines. Before a bull's horns grow out, a headboard is fastened to
  its  forehead, so that later when the horns appear they cannot do harm. 
A  good  way to restrain wild force is to forestall it. By so doing one achieves 
  an  easy and great success.<br>
           Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The tusk of a gelded boar.<br>
          Good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Here the restraining of the impetuous forward drive is achieved in 
   an indirect way. A boar's tusk is in itself dangerous, but if the boar's 
   nature is altered, the tusk is no longer a menace. Thus also where men 
are   concerned, wild force should not be combated directly; instead, its 
roots   should be eradicated.<br>
           Nine at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  One attains the way of heaven.</p>
                            
<p>  Success.</p>
                            
<p>  The time of obstruction is past. The energy long dammed up by inhibition 
    forces its way out and achieves great success. This refers to a man who 
  is  honored by the ruler and whose principles now prevail and shape the 
world.      </p>
