         49. Ko / Revolution (Molting)</b>                            </p>

          below  LI  THE CLINGING, FIRE</p>
                            
<p>  The Chinese character for this hexagram means in its original sense 
   an animal's pelt, which is changed in the course of the year by molting. 
   From this word is carried over to apply to the "moltings" in political 
life,   the great revolutions connected with changes of governments.  The 
two trigrams    making up the hexagram are the same two that appear in K'uei, 
OPPOSITION     </p>

that is, the two younger daughters, Li and Tui.     But while there the elder
of the two daughters is above, and what results     is essentially only an
opposition of tendencies, here the younger daughter     is above. The influences
are in actual conflict, and the forces combat  each   other like fire and
water (lake), each trying to destroy the other.  Hence   the idea of revolution.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  REVOLUTION. On your own day<br>
          You are believed.</p>
                            
<p>  Supreme success,<br>
          Furthering through perseverance.<br>
          Remorse disappears.</p>
                            
<p>  Political revolutions are extremely grave matters. They should be undertaken
only under stress of direst necessity, when there is no other way out. Not
everyone is called to this task, but only the man who has the confidence
of the people, and even he only when the time is ripe. He must then proceed
in the right way, so that he gladdens the people and, by enlightening them,
prevents excesses. Furthermore, he must be quite free of selfish aims and
must really relieve the need of the people. Only then does he have nothing 
    to regret.  Times change, and with them their demands. Thus the seasons 
  change  in the course of the year. In the world cycle also there are spring 
  and autumn  in the life of peoples and nations, and these call for social 
  transformations.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Fire in the lake: the image of REVOLUTION.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the superior man</p>
                            
<p>  Sets the calendar in order<br>
          And makes the seasons clear.</p>
                            
<p>  Fire below and the lake above combat and destroy each other. So too 
   in the course of the year a combat takes place between the forces of light
    and the forces of darkness, eventuating in the revolution of the seasons,
    and man is able to adjust himself in advance to the demands of the different
    times.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  Wrapped in the hide of a yellow cow.</p>
                            
<p>  Changes ought to be undertaken only when there is nothing else to be
done. Therefore at first the utmost restraint is necessary. One must becomes 
    firm in one's mind, control oneself-yellow is the color of the means, 
and    the cow is the symbol of docility-and refrain from doing anything for
the    time being, because any premature offensive will bring evil results.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  When one's own day comes, one may create revolution.</p>
                            
<p>  Starting brings good fortune. No blame.</p>
                            
<p>  When we have tried in every other way to bring about reforms, but without
success, revolution becomes necessary. But such a thoroughgoing upheaval must
be carefully prepared. There must be available a man who has the requisite 
    abilities and who possesses public confidence. To such a man we may well 
   turn. This brings good fortune and is not a mistake. The first thing to 
 be  considered is our inner attitude toward the new condition that will inevitably
   come. We have to go out to meet it, as it were. Only in this way can it
 be  prepared for.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Starting brings misfortune.<br>
          Perseverance brings danger.<br>
          When talk of revolution has gone the rounds three times,<br>
          One may commit himself,<br>
          And men will believe him.</p>
                            
<p>  When change is necessary, there are two mistakes to be avoided. One 
   lies in excessive haste and ruthlessness, which bring disaster. The other 
    lies in excessive hesitation and conservatism, which are also dangerous. 
   Not every demand for change in the existing order should be heeded. On 
the   other hand, repeated and well-founded complaints should not fail of 
a hearing.   When talk of change has come to one's ears three times, and has
been pondered   well, he may believe and acquiesce in it. Then he will meet
with belief and  will accomplish something.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Remorse disappears. Men believe him.<br>
          Changing the form of government brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Radical changes require adequate authority. A man must have inner strength
as well as influential position. What he does must correspond with a higher
truth and must not spring from arbitrary or petty motives; then it brings
great good fortune. If a revolution is not founded on such inner truth, the
results are bad, and it has no success. For in the end men will support only
those undertakings which they feel instinctively to be just.<br>
           Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The great man changes like a tiger.<br>
          Even before he questions the oracle<br>
          He is believed.</p>
                            
<p>  A tigerskin, with its highly visible black stripes on a yellow ground, 
    shows its distinct pattern from afar. It is the same with a revolution 
 brought   about by a great man: large, clear guiding lines become visible, 
 understandable   to everyone. Therefore he need not first consult the oracle, 
 for he wins  the spontaneous support of the people.</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  The superior man changes like a panther.</p>
                            
<p>  The inferior man molts in the face.</p>
                            
<p>  Starting brings misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  To remain persevering brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  After the large and fundamental problems are settled, certain minor 
   reforms, and elaborations of these, are necessary. These detailed reforms 
    may be likened to the equally distinct but relatively small marks of the
   panther's coat. As a consequence, a change also takes place among the
inferior    people. In conformity with the new order, they likewise "molt." 
This molting,    it is true, does not go very deep, but that is not to be 
expected. We must    be satisfied with the attainable. If we should go too 
far and try to achieve     too much, it would lead to unrest and misfortune. 
For the object of a great    revolution is the attainment of clarified, secure 
conditions ensuring a  general  stabilization on the basis of what is possible 
at the moment.</p>
