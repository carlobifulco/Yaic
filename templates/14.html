          14. Ta Yu / Possession in Great Measure                 
          </b></p>
<p>  above  LI  THE CLINGING, FLAME<br>
          below  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN</p>
                            
<p>  The fire in heaven above shines far, and all things stand out in the 
    light and become manifest. The weak fifth line occupies the place of honor
    and all the strong lines are in accord with it.All things come to the
man    who is modest and kind in a high position.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE.</p>
                            
<p>  Supreme success.</p>
                            
<p>  The two trigrams indicate that strength and clarity unite. Possessions 
    great measure is determined by fate and accords with the time. How is 
it   possible that the weak line has power to hold the strong lines fast and
to  possess them? It is done by virtue of unselfish modesty. The time is
favorable--a   time of strength within, clarity and culture without. Power 
 is expressing   itself in graceful and controlled way. This brings supreme 
 success and wealth.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Fire in heaven above:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of POSSESSION IN GREAT MEASURE.<br>
          Thus the superior man curbs evil and furthers good,<br>
          And thereby obeys the benevolent will of heaven.</p>
                            
<p>  The sun in heaven above, shedding light over everything one earth, 
   is the image of possession on a grand scale. But a possession of this sort
   must be administered properly. The sun brings both evil and good into
the    light of day. Man must combat and curb the evil, and must favor and
promote    the good. Only in this way does he fulfill the benevolent will
of God, who   desires only good and not evil.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  No relationship with what is harmful;<br>
          There is no blame in this.<br>
          If one remains conscious of difficulty,<br>
          One remains without blame.</p>
                            
<p>  Great possession that is still in its beginnings and that has not yet
been challenged brings no blame, since there has been no opportunity to make
mistakes. Yet there are many difficulties to be overcome. It is only by remaining
conscious of theses difficulties that one can keep inwardly free of possible
arrogance and wastefulness, and thus in principle overcome all cause for
blame.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  A big wagon for loading.<br>
          One may undertake something.<br>
          No blame.</p>
                            
<p>  Great possession consists not only in the quantity of goods at one's 
    disposal, but first and foremost, in their mobility and utility, for then
    they can be used in undertakings, and we remain free of embarrassment 
and    mistakes. The big wagon, which will carry a heavy load and in which 
one  can  journey farm means that there are at hand able helpers who give 
their  support  t and are equal to their task. One can load great responsibility 
  upon such  persons, and this is necessary in important undertakings.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  A prince offers it to the Son of Heaven.<br>
          A petty man cannot do this.</p>
                            
<p>  A magnanimous, liberal-minded man should not regard what he possesses 
    as his exclusive personal property , but should place it at the disposal 
   of the ruler or of the people at large. In so doing, he takes the right 
 attitude   toward his possession, which as private property can never endure. 
 A petty   man is incapable of this. He is harmed by great possessions, because 
 instead   of sacrificing them, he would keep them for himself.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  He makes a difference<br>
          Between himself and his neighbor.<br>
          No blame.</p>
                            
<p>  This characterizes the position of a man placed among rich and powerful 
    neighbors. It is a dangerous position. He must look neither to the right 
   nor to the left, and must shun envy and the temptation to vie with others. 
   In this way he remains free of mistakes.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  He whose truth is accessible, yet dignified,<br>
          Has good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  The situation is very favorable. People are being won not by coercion 
    but by unaffected sincerity, so that they are attached to us in sincerity 
    and truth. However, benevolence alone is not sufficient at the time of 
 POSSESSION   IN GREAT MEASURE. For insolence might begin to spread. Insolence 
 must be  kept in bounds by dignity; then good fortune is assured.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  He is blessed by heaven.<br>
          Good fortune.<br>
          Nothing that does not further.</p>
                            
<p>  In the fullness of possession and at the height of power, one remains 
    modest and gives honor to the sage who stands outside the affairs of the
   world. By this means one puts oneself under the beneficent influence descending
   form heaven, and all goes well. Confucius says of this line:</p>
                            
<p>  To bless means to help. Heaven helps the man who is devoted; men help 
    the man who is true. He who walks in truth and is devoted in his thinking, 
    and furthermore reveres the worthy, is blessed by heaven. He has good 
fortune,    and there is nothing that would not further.</p>
