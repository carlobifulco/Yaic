         31. Hsien / Influence (Wooing)</b>                            </p>
<p>  above  TUI  THE JOYOUS, LAKE<br>
          below  K&ecirc;N  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN</p>
                            
<p>  The name of the hexagram means "universal," "general," and in a figurative 
    sense "to influence," "to stimulate." The upper trigram is Tui, the Joyous; 
    the lower is K&ecirc;n, Keeping still. By its persistent, quiet influence, 
    the lower, rigid trigram stimulates the upper, weak trigram, which responds 
    to this stimulation cheerfully and joyously. K&ecirc;n, the lower trigram, 
    is the youngest son; the upper, Tui, is the youngest daughter. Thus the 
  universal  mutual attraction between the sexes is represented. In courtship, 
  the masculine  principle must seize the initiative and place itself below 
  the feminine principle.   Just as the first part of book 1 begins with the
  hexagrams of heaven and  earth, the foundations of all that exists, the
second  part begins with the  hexagrams of courtship and marriage, the foundations
  of all social relationships.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  Influence. Success.<br>
          Perseverance furthers.</p>
                            
<p>  To take a maiden to wife brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  The weak element is above, the strong below; hence their powers attract 
    each other, so that they unite. This brings about success, for all success 
    depends on the effect of mutual attraction. By keeping still within while 
    experiencing joy without, one can prevent the joy from going to excess 
 and   hold it within proper bounds. This is the meaning of the added admonition, 
    "Perseverance furthers," for it is perseverance that makes the difference 
    between seduction and courtship; in the latter the strong man takes a 
position    inferior to that of the weak girl and shows consideration for 
her. This  attraction  between affinities is a general law of nature. Heaven 
and earth  attract each  other and thus all creatures come into being. Through 
such attraction the  sage influences men's hearts, and thus the world attains 
peace. From the attractions they exert we can learn the nature of all beings 
in heaven and on earth.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  A lake on the mountain:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of influence.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the superior man encourages people to approach him<br>
          By his readiness to receive them.</p>
                            
<p>  A mountain with a lake on its summit is stimulated by the moisture 
   from the lake. It has this advantage because its summit does not jut out
   as a peak but is sunken. The image counsels that the mind should be kept
  humble and free, so that it may remain receptive to good advice. People 
soon  give up counseling a man who thinks that he knows everything better 
than anyone else.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  The influence shows itself in the big toe.</p>
                            
<p>  A movement, before it is actually carried out, shows itself first in
the toes. The idea of an influence is already present, but is not immediately 
    apparent to others. As long as the intention has no visible effect, it 
 is   of no importance to the outside world and leads neither to good nor 
to evil.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The influence shows itself in the calves of the legs.<br>
          Misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Tarrying brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  In movement, the calf of the leg follows the foot; by itself it can 
   neither go forward nor stand still. Since the movement is not self-governed, 
    it bodes ill. One should wait quietly until one is impelled to action 
by   a real influence. Then one remains uninjured.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The influence shows itself in the thighs.<br>
          Holds to that which follows it.</p>
                            
<p>  To continue is humiliating.<br>
          </p>
                            
<p>  Every mood of the heart influences us to movement. What the heart desires,
the thighs run after without a moment's hesitation; they hold to the heart,
which they follow. In the life of man, however, acting on the spur of every
caprice is wrong and if continued leads to humiliation. Three considerations
suggest themselves here. First, a man should not run precipitately after
all the persons whom he would like to influence, but must be able to hold
back under certain circumstances. As little should he yield immediately to
every whim of those in whose service he stands. Finally, where the moods of
his own heart are concerned, he should never ignore the possibility of inhibition,
for this is the basis of human freedom.<br>
           Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
          Remorse disappears.<br>
          If a man is agitated in mind,<br>
          And his thoughts go hither and thither,<br>
          Only those friends <br>
          On whom he fixes his conscious thoughts<br>
          Will follow.</p>
                            
<p>  Here the place of the heart is reached. The impulse that springs from 
    this source is the most important of all. It is of particular concern 
that    this influence be constant and good; then, in spite of the danger 
arising    from the great susceptibility of the human heart, there will be 
no cause   for remorse. When the quiet power of a man's own character is at
work, the   effects produced are right. All those who are receptive to the
vibrations   of such a spirit will then be influenced. Influence over others
should not   express itself as a conscious and willed effort to manipulate 
them. Through   practicing such conscious incitement, one becomes wrought 
up and is exhausted   by the eternal stress and strain. Moreover, the effects 
produced are then   limited to those on whom one's thoughts are consciously 
fixed.<br>
           Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The influence shows itself in the back of the neck.</p>
                            
<p>  No remorse.</p>
                            
<p>  The back of the neck is the most rigid part of the body. When the influence
shows itself there, the will remains firm and the influence does not lead
to confusion. Hence remorse does not enter into consideration here. What
takes place in the depths of one's being, in the unconscious mind. It is
true that if we cannot be influenced ourselves, we cannot influence the outside
world.</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  The influence shows itself in the jaws, cheeks, and tongue.</p>
                            
<p>  The most superficial way of trying to influence others is through talk
that has nothing real behind it. The influence produced by such mere tongue
wagging must necessarily remain insignificant. Hence no indication is added
regarding good or bad fortune.</p>
