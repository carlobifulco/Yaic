         25. Wu Wang / Innocence (The Unexpected)</b>                   
        </p>
<p>  above  CH'IEN  THE CREATIVE, HEAVEN<br>
          below  CH&ecirc;N  THE AROUSING, THUNDER</p>
                            
<p>  Ch'ien, heaven is above; Ch&ecirc;n, movement, is below. The lower 
   trigram Ch&ecirc;n is under the influence of the strong line it has received 
    form above, from heaven. When, in accord with this, movement follows the
   law of heaven, man is innocent and without guile. His mind is natural and
   true, unshadowed by reflection or ulterior designs. For wherever conscious 
   purpose is to be seen, there the truth and innocence of nature have been 
  lost. Nature that is not directed by the spirit is not true but degenerate 
  nature. Starting out with the idea of the natural, the train of thought 
in  part goes somewhat further and thus the hexagram includes also the idea 
of  the fundamental or unexpected.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  INNOCENCE. Supreme success.<br>
          Perseverance furthers.<br>
          If someone is not as he should be,<br>
          He has misfortune,<br>
          And it does not further him<br>
          To undertake anything.</p>
                            
<p>  Man has received from heaven a nature innately good, to guide him in
all his movements. By devotion to this divine spirit within himself, he attains
an unsullied innocence that leads him to do right with instinctive sureness
and without any ulterior thought of reward and personal advantage. This instinctive
certainty brings about supreme success and 'furthers through perseverance".
However, not everything instinctive is nature in this higher sense of the
word, but only that which is right and in accord with the will of heaven.
Without this quality of rightness, an unreflecting, instinctive way of acting
brings only misfortune. Confucius says about this: "He who departs from innocence,
what does he come to? Heaven's will and blessing do not go with his deeds."</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Under heaven thunder rolls:<br>
          All things attain the natural state of innocence.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the kings of old,<br>
          Rich in virtue, and in harmony with the time,<br>
          Fostered and nourished all beings.</p>
                            
<p>  In springtime when thunder, life energy, begins to move again under 
   the heavens, everything sprouts and grows, and all beings receive for the
   creative activity of nature the childlike innocence of their original state.
   So it is with the good rulers of mankind: drawing on the spiritual wealth
   at their command, they take care of all forms of life and all forms of
culture   and do everything to further them, and at the proper time.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>   Nine at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  Innocent behavior brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  The original impulses of the heart are always good, so that we may 
   follow them confidently, assured of good fortune and achievement of our 
  aims.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  If one does not count on the harvest while plowing,</p>
                            
<p>  Nor on the use of the ground while clearing it,<br>
          It furthers one to undertake something.</p>
                            
<p>  We should do every task for its own sake as time and place demand and
not with an eye to the result. Then each task turns out well, and anything 
    we undertake succeeds.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Undeserved misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  The cow that was tethered by someone<br>
          Is the wanderer's gain, the citizen's loss.</p>
                            
<p>  Sometimes undeserved misfortune befalls a man at the hands of another, 
    as for instance when someone passes by and takes a tethered cow along 
with    him. His gain is the owner's loss. In all transactions, no matter 
how innocent,    we must accommodate ourselves to the demands of the time, 
otherwise unexpected    misfortune overtakes us.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  He who can be persevering <br>
          Remains without blame.<br>
          </p>
                            
<p>  We cannot lose what really belongs to us, even if we throw it away. 
   Therefore we need have no anxiety. All that need concern us is that we 
 should   remain true to our own natures and not listen to others.<br>
           Nine in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Use no medicine in an illness<br>
          Incurred through no fault of your own.<br>
          It will pass of itself.</p>
                            
<p>  An unexpected evil may come accidentally from without. If it does not
originate in one's own nature or have a foothold there, one should not resort
to external means to eradicate it, but should quietly let nature take its
course. Then improvement will come of itself.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  Innocent action brings misfortune.</p>
                            
<p>  Nothing furthers.</p>
                            
<p>  When, in a given situation, the time is not ripe for further progress, 
    the best thing to do is to wait quietly, without ulterior designs. If 
one    acts thoughtlessly and tries to push ahead in opposition to fate, success
   will not be achieved.</p>
