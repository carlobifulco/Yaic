         46.  Sh&ecirc;ng / Pushing Upward                        
   </b></p>
<p>  above K'UN  THE RECEPTIVE, EARTH<br>
          below SUN  THE GENTLE, WIND, WOOD</p>
                            
<p>  The lower trigram, Sun, represents wood, and the upper, K'un, means 
   the earth. Linked with this is the idea that wood in the earth grows upward.
    In contrast to the meaning of Chin, PROGRESS </p>
                            
<p>  <a
 href="file:///c:/All_my_docs/YAIC/I_Ching_Wilhelm_Translation.html#35">35</a>,
this pushing upward is associated with effort,     just as a plant needs
energy for pushing upward through the earth. That   is  why this hexagram,
although it is connected with success, is associated   with  effort of the
will. In PROGRESS the emphasis is on expansion; PUSHING   UPWARD  indicates
rather a vertical ascent-direct rise from obscurity and   lowliness  to power
and influence.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  PUSHING UPWARD has supreme success.<br>
          One must see the great man.<br>
          Fear not.<br>
          Departure toward the south<br>
          Brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  The pushing upward of the good elements encounters no obstruction and
is therefore accompanied by great success. The pushing upward is made possible
not by violence but by modesty and adaptability. Since the individual is
borne along by the propitiousness of the time, he advances.  He must go to
see authoritative people. He need not be afraid to do this, because success 
    is assured. But he must set to work, for activity (this is the meaning 
 of   "the south") brings good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  Within the earth, wood grows:</p>
                            
<p>  The image of PUSHING UPWARD.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the superior man of devoted character<br>
          Heaps up small things<br>
          In order to achieve something high and great.</p>
                            
<p>  Adapting itself to obstacles and bending around them, wood in the earth
grows upward without haste and without rest. Thus too the superior man is
devoted in character and never pauses in his progress.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  Pushing upward that meets with confidence<br>
          Brings great good fortune.</p>
                            
<p>  This situation at the beginning of ascent. Just as wood draws strength 
    for its upward push from the root, which in itself is in the lowest place, 
    so the power to rise comes from this low and obscure station. But there 
  is  a spiritual affinity with the rulers above, and this solidarity creates 
  the  confidence needed to accomplish something.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  If one is sincere,<br>
          It furthers one to bring even a small offering.</p>
                            
<p>  No blame.</p>
                            
<p>  Here a strong man is presupposed. It is true that he does not fit in
with his environment, inasmuch as he is too brusque and pays too little attention
to form. But as he is upright in character, he meets with response, and his
lack of outward form does no harm. Here uprightness is the outcome of sound
qualities of character, whereas in the corresponding line of the preceding
hexagram it is the result of innate humility.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  One pushes upward into an empty city.<br>
          </p>
                            
<p>  All obstructions that generally block progress fall away here. Things 
    proceed with remarkable ease. Unhesitatingly one follows this road, in 
 order   to profit by one's success. Seen from without, everything seems to
 be in  the best of order. However, no promise of good fortune is added. 
It is a  question how long such unobstructed success can last. But it is wise
not to yield to such misgivings, because they only inhibit one's power. Instead,
 the point is to profit by the propitiousness of time.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  The king offers him Mount Ch'i.<br>
          Good fortune. No blame.</p>
                            
<p>  Mount Ch'i is in the western China, the homeland of King W&ecirc;n, 
   whose son, the Duke of Chou, added the words to the individual lines. The
   pronouncement takes us back to a time when the Chou dynasty was coming 
 into   power. At that time King W&ecirc;n introduced his illustrious helpers 
 to  the god of his native mountain, and they received their places in the 
 halls  of the ancestors by the side of the ruler. This indicates a stage 
in which  pushing upward attains its goal. One acquires fame in the sight 
of gods and  men, is received into the circle of those who foster the spiritual 
 life of  the nation, and thereby attains a significance that endures beyond 
 time.<br>
           Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
          One pushes upward by steps.</p>
                            
<p>  When a man is advancing farther and farther, it is important for him 
    not to become intoxicated by success. Precisely when he experiences great 
    success it is necessary to remain sober and not to try to skip any stages; 
    he must go on slowly, step by step, as though hesitant. Only such calm, 
  steady  progress, overleaping nothing, leads to the goal.</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  Pushing upward in darkness.<br>
          It furthers one</p>
                            
<p>  To be unremittingly persevering.</p>
                            
<p>  He who pushes upward blindly deludes himself. He knows only advance, 
    not retreat. But this means exhaustion. In such a case it is important 
 to   be constantly mindful that one must be conscientious and consistent 
and must  remain so. Only thus does one become free of blind impulse, which 
is always  harmful.</p>
