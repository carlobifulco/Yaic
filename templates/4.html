         4. M&ecirc;ng / Youthful Folly</b>                            </p>
<p>  above  K&ecirc;N  KEEPING STILL, MOUNTAIN <br>
          below  K'AN  THE ABYSMAL, WATER</p>
                            
<p>  In this hexagram we are reminded of youth and folly in two different 
    ways. The image of the upper trigram, K&ecirc;n, is the mountain, that 
 of   the lower, K'an, is water; the spring rising at the foot of the mountain 
   is the image of inexperienced youth. Keeping still is the attribute of 
the   upper trigram; that of the lower is the abyss, danger. Stopping in perplexity
  on the brink of a dangerous abyss is a symbol of the folly of youth. However,
   the two trigrams also show the way of overcoming the follies of youth.
Water   is something that of necessity flows on. When the spring gushes forth,
it   does not know at first where it will go. But its steady flow fills up
the   deep place blocking its progress, and success is attained.</p>
                            
<p>  THE JUDGMENT</p>
                            
<p>  YOUTHFUL FOLLY has success.<br>
          It is not I who seek the young fool;<br>
          The young fool seeks me.<br>
          At the first oracle I inform him. <br>
          If he asks two or three times, it is importunity.<br>
          If he importunes, I give him no information.<br>
          Perseverance furthers.</p>
                            
<p>  In the time of youth, folly is not an evil. One may succeed in spite 
    of it, provided one finds an experienced teacher and has the right attitude 
    toward him. This means, first of all, that the youth himself must be conscious
    of his lack of experience and must seek out the teacher. Without this
modesty    and this interest there is no guarantee that he has the necessary 
receptivity,    which should express itself in respectful acceptance of the 
teacher. This    is the reason why the teacher must wait to be sought out 
instead of offering    himself. Only thus can the instruction take place at
the right time and  in  the right way.  A teacher's answer to the question 
of a pupil ought to  be  clear and definite like that expected from an oracle; 
thereupon it ought   to be accepted as a key for resolution of doubts and 
a basis for decision.   If mistrustful or unintelligent questioning is kept 
up, it serves only to   annoy the teacher. He does well to ignore it in silence, 
just as the oracle   gives one answer only and refuses to be tempted by questions 
 implying doubt.    Given addition a perseverance that never slackens until 
 the points are mastered   one by one, real success is sure to follow. Thus 
 the hexagram counsels the   teacher as well as the pupil.</p>
                            
<p>  THE IMAGE</p>
                            
<p>  A spring wells up at the foot of the mountain:<br>
          The image of YOUTH.</p>
                            
<p>  Thus the superior man fosters his character<br>
          By thoroughness in all that he does.</p>
                            
<p>  A spring succeeds in flowing on and escapes stagnation by filling up
all the hollow places in its path. In the same way character is developed 
    by thoroughness that skips nothing but, like water, gradually and steadily 
    fills up all gaps and so flows onward.</p>
                            
<p>  THE LINES</p>
                            
<p>  Six at the beginning means:</p>
                            
<p>  To make a fool develop<br>
          It furthers one to apply discipline.<br>
          The fetters should be removed.<br>
          To go on in this way bring humiliation.</p>
                            
<p>  Law is the beginning of education. Youth in its inexperience is inclined 
    at first to take everything carelessly and playfully.  It must be shown 
  the  seriousness of life. A certain measure of taking oneself in hand, brought
    about by strict discipline, is a good thing. He who plays with life never
    amounts to anything. However, discipline should not degenerate into drill.
    Continuous drill has a humiliating effect and cripples a man's powers.</p>
                            
<p>   Nine in the second place means:</p>
                            
<p>  To bear with fools in kindliness brings good fortune.<br>
          To know how to take women<br>
          Brings good fortune.<br>
          The son is capable of taking charge of the household.</p>
                            
<p>  These lines picture a man who has no external power, but who has enough 
    strength of mind to bear his burden of responsibility. He has the inner 
  superiority  and that enable him to tolerate with kindliness the shortcomings 
  of human  folly. The same attitude is owed to women as the weaker sex. One
  must understand  them and give them recognition in a spirit of chivalrous 
  consideration. Only  this combination of inner strength with outer reserve 
  enables one to take  on the responsibility of directing a larger social 
body  with real success.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the third place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Take not a maiden who. When she sees a man of bronze,<br>
          Loses possession of herself.<br>
          Nothing furthers.</p>
                            
<p>  A weak, inexperienced man, struggling to rise, easily loses his own 
   individuality when he slavishly imitates a strong personality of higher 
  station.  He is like a girl throwing herself away when she meets a strong 
  man. Such  a servile approach should not be encouraged, because it is bad 
  both for the  youth and the teacher. A girl owes it to her dignity to wait 
  until she is  wooed. In both cases it is undignified to offer oneself, and
  no good comes  of accepting such an offer.</p>
                            
<p>  Six in the fourth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Entangled folly bring humiliation.<br>
          </p>
                            
<p>  For youthful folly it is the most hopeless thing to entangle itself 
   in empty imaginings. The more obstinately it clings to such unreal fantasies, 
    the more certainly will humiliation overtake it. Often the teacher, when 
   confronted with such entangled folly, has no other course but to leave 
the   fool to himself for a time, not sparing him the humiliation that results. 
   This is frequently the only means of rescue.<br>
           Six in the fifth place means:</p>
                            
<p>  Childlike folly brings good fortune. </p>
                            
<p>  An inexperienced person who seeks instruction in a childlike and unassuming 
    way is on the right path, for the man devoid of arrogance who subordinated 
    himself to his teacher will certainly be helped.</p>
                            
<p>  Nine at the top means:</p>
                            
<p>  In punishing folly<br>
          It does not further one<br>
          To commit transgressions.<br>
          The only thing that furthers <br>
          Is to prevent transgressions.</p>
                            
<p>  Sometimes an incorrigible fool must be punished. He who will not heed 
    will be made to feel. This punishment is quite different from a preliminary 
    shaking up. But the penalty should not be imposed in anger; it must be 
 restricted   to an objective guarding against unjustified excesses. Punishment 
 is never   an end in itself but serves merely to restore order.  This applies 
 not only   in regard to education but also in regard to the measures taken 
 by a government   against a populace guilty of transgressions. Governmental 
 interference should   always be merely preventive and should have as its 
sole aim the establishment   of public security and peace. </p>
